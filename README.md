# 🧠 NeuroWeave

**Weaving the Future of Adaptive Intelligence**

NeuroWeave is an open research and development organization building cutting-edge tools, libraries, and frameworks at the intersection of **emotion-aware AI**, **reinforcement learning**, **privacy-preserving agents**, and **adaptive edge systems**.
We believe in building transparent, ethical, and performant AI infrastructure for the real world — accessible to everyone.

## 🔬 Our Vision

Modern AI systems must **adapt**, **understand**, and **respect** their users. At NeuroWeave, we are:

* 🌐 Building **agentic AI frameworks** that personalize interactions in real time
* 🤖 Developing **reinforcement learning** toolkits that prioritize modularity, fast prototyping, and deployment
* 🧠 Exploring **emotion-adaptive architectures** that respond to human affect using multimodal cues
* 🔐 Creating **privacy-first AI infrastructure**, with **federated**, **local**, and **robust** training paradigms
* 🧩 Designing research-ready **meta-learning** and **contrastive learning** modules
